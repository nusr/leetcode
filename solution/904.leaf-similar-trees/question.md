Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.&nbsp; From&nbsp;left to right order, the values of those&nbsp;leaves form a leaf value sequence.



For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar&nbsp;if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

&nbsp;

Note:


	Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
